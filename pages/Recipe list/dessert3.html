            <p>What is Lorem Ipsum?<br>
                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's <br>
                standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to <br>
                make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic <br>
                typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset <br>
                sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus <br>
                PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. <br>
                
                Why do we use it? <br>
                It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking <br> 
                at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, <br>
                as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing <br>
                packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' <br>
                will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes <br>
                by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like). <br>
                
                
                Where does it come from? <br>
                Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin <br>
                literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney <br>
                College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, <br>
                and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. <br>
                Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good <br>
                and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during <br>
                the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section <br>
                1.10.32. <br>
                
                The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections  <br>
                form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham. <br>
                1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original <br>
                Where can I get some? <br>
                There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in <br>
                some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are <br>
                going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the <br>
                middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, <br>
                making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined <br>
                with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated <br>
                Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>
